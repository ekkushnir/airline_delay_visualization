# Flight delays visualization with Tableau

This project is a data visualization project created with _Tableau_. The dataset on flight delays was originally downloaded from Bureau of Transportation and wrangled subsequently in order to prepare it for analysis and visualization. The final product is a _Tableau_ strory about causes of flight delays and differences in flight delays across airports and airlines and over time. Delay causes are classified into delays due to air carrier, National Aviation System (NAS), late-arriving aircraft, extreme weather and security.
